## Pinpoint Data Handling and Connection with the Aws-Amplify

- Pinpoint helps us to get the data from the user and it goes to the server as well,
- It is supported with the Aws-Ampify service from the frontend and it gets the data easily to the server ,
- We just need to connect our endpoint (Amplify app ) with the pinpoint server so it can apply the analytics all the way
- It will conect to the cognito service to have the userpool and by that the data will be going to the pinpoint server.
- There is particularly the code for the frontend as well to connect the pinpoint with the amplify to get the data.
- All the data will be collected by the events , therefore it will make the analytics though where to use it.

## Pinpoint process

- ANALYTICS -> SELECT THE AUDIENCE -> SELECT PREFERRED COMMUNICATION CHANNEL -> WRITE MESSAGE -> SCHEDULE THE CAMPAIGN -> RESULTS

- On the basis of the results by the frontend from amplify (clientside) the data is on the server and analytics is applied on that particular data though , we create te segmensts by which we will going to send email / sms / voice-messages and any other thing to the clients.
- On the basis of the analytical results , we will going to run our campaign and thats the part here though
- It depends upon us what campaign we run either we send the emails daily or weekly and what logic we are implementing it also depends upon us though all the way.

- On the basis of the segment , message will be created though and the message will be send to the user through the medium we selected though.
- There is machine learning models as well in the pinpoint
